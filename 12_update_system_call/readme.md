**System Call Table Manipulation in Kernel** 🛠️📜

---

- **Concept**:
  - The system call table, represented by `sys_call_table` in the kernel, is a table of function pointers corresponding to system calls.
  - In the provided code, the aim is to replace (or "hook") the system call for `open` with a custom implementation named `my_open`.
  - `my_open` logs a message when called and then redirects the call to the original `open` system call.
  - The `sys_call_table` resides in a read-only memory section. To modify it, the write protection needs to be temporarily disabled.
  - In x86 architecture, the Write Protect bit in the CR0 register controls the CPU's ability to write to read-only pages at privilege level 0 (kernel mode). By toggling this bit, the kernel can make changes to such protected pages.
  
- **Curious Questions**:
  - **Q1**: Why would someone want to hook a system call?
    - **Answer**: Hooking a system call allows developers to introduce custom behaviors, intercept or modify arguments and return values, monitor specific operations, or add debugging and logging capabilities.
  
  - **Q2**: How can the Write Protect bit in CR0 be toggled in kernel code?
    - **Answer**: By using the `read_cr0()` and `write_cr0()` functions. To disable write protection, the WP bit (16th bit) can be cleared, and to enable it, the bit is set.
  
  - **Q3**: Are there any risks associated with modifying the `sys_call_table`?
    - **Answer**: Yes, incorrect manipulation can lead to system instability, unintended behaviors, or vulnerabilities. Furthermore, hooking system calls is often associated with rootkits, making it potentially detectable by security software.
  
- **In Simple words**:
  - Imagine a vault 🏦 with important documents. Normally, you can only read these documents. However, with a special key 🔑 (in our case, toggling the CR0's WP bit), you can temporarily write or replace a document. Once done, you lock the vault again. In this analogy, the vault is the `sys_call_table`, and the documents are the system calls. Always ensure you safely lock the vault after changes to prevent unintended consequences! 🔒📜.
