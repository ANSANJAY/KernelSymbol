**Understanding `kallsyms_lookup_name` in the Linux Kernel** üêßüîç

- **Explain the Technical Concept**:
  - `kallsyms_lookup_name` is a kernel function specifically designed for symbol resolution within the kernel space.
  - It accepts a symbol's name as its argument.
  - If the symbol is present, it returns the symbol's address in the memory.
  - It plays a significant role in dynamically discovering the memory address of specific kernel functions or variables.
  - The address can then be dereferenced to access or manipulate that specific symbol.
  - If the symbol isn't found, it indeed returns NULL, indicating the absence of the queried symbol in the current context.
  
  - `/proc/kallsyms` provides a mapping of symbols to their addresses in the kernel. Running `cat /proc/kallsyms | grep sys_call_table` will provide the address of the `sys_call_table` in the memory, which is vital for certain kernel-related tasks, like system call hooking.

- **Curious Questions**:
  - **Q1**: Why might someone want to use `kallsyms_lookup_name` in kernel development?
    - **Answer**: It's a way to dynamically discover and interact with kernel symbols. Especially useful when one wants to perform actions like function hooking, where you need the address of a specific kernel function to modify or intercept its behavior.
  
  - **Q2**: What's the significance of the `sys_call_table` in the kernel?
    - **Answer**: The `sys_call_table` is a table of function pointers that point to system call implementations. When a system call is invoked, the kernel uses this table to jump to the correct function, executing the desired system call.
  
  - **Q3**: Why is `kallsyms_lookup_name` beneficial over hardcoding memory addresses?
    - **Answer**: Kernel versions and configurations can differ, leading to symbols being at different memory addresses. `kallsyms_lookup_name` provides a dynamic and reliable way to fetch the current address, avoiding the fragility and maintenance nightmare of hardcoded addresses.

- **Explain in Simple Words for Memory**:
  - Imagine you're in a vast library üìö. Instead of searching manually for a book, you use a special tool (like `kallsyms_lookup_name`) that instantly tells you exactly where that book is. Even if the library gets new books or rearranges, this tool always knows where each book is, ensuring you don't have to remember or guess its location. Similarly, this function gives us the exact "location" of a kernel symbol, no matter how the kernel changes or evolves.
