**Manipulating Kernel Symbol Addresses** üíª‚úèÔ∏è

---

- **Explain the Technical Concept**:
  - In the Linux kernel, symbols refer to addresses where variables and functions reside.
  - The provided code seems to illustrate a technique known as "function hooking" where you replace a function's address with your own to "intercept" calls to that function.
  - The `my_print_cpu_info` function serves as a hook, which gets called instead of the original function when the symbol address is overridden.
  - However, a crucial point missing here is that you can't just assign the new function address to the symbol directly. Memory pages holding the kernel's text are write-protected, and attempting to modify them directly will result in a kernel oops or panic. To safely update these addresses, you'll need to make the pages writable temporarily.
  - As highlighted, trying to write directly to a read-only section will result in kernel errors. This is why such manipulations must be approached with caution and awareness of the kernel's memory protections.

- **Curious Questions**:
  - **Q1**: What is "function hooking"?
    - **Answer**: It's a technique used to intercept function calls by redirecting the call to another function, often to alter the behavior, inspect values, or inject code.
  
  - **Q2**: How can you safely modify a read-only section in the kernel?
    - **Answer**: Temporarily change the memory page attributes to be writable using functions like `set_memory_rw`. After the modification, it's important to revert the permissions back with `set_memory_ro`.
  
  - **Q3**: Why doesn't the kernel allow write access to certain sections by default?
    - **Answer**: It's a security and stability feature. Making certain sections read-only prevents accidental (or malicious) modifications that could crash the kernel or introduce vulnerabilities.

- **Explain in Simple Words for Memory**:
  - Picture a museum üèõÔ∏è with priceless artifacts. Some items are in the open, while others are behind glass. If you want to interact with the guarded artifacts, you'd need special permission and care. Similarly, in the kernel, certain memory sections are "guarded" (read-only) to prevent mishandling. If you force your way without precautions, alarms (kernel oops/panic) sound off. Always handle with extreme care and knowledge of what you're doing! üö´üñêÔ∏è.
