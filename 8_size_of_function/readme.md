**Unpacking `sprint_symbol` for Function Size Discovery** 📏🔍

---

- **Concept**:
  - The kernel contains a multitude of functions, each occupying a certain space in memory.
  - `sprint_symbol` is a utility provided by the kernel to fetch details about a symbol (like a function) based on its address.
  - The function retrieves:
    - The **name** of the symbol (e.g., function name).
    - The **offset** from the start of the symbol.
    - The **size** of the symbol, which is particularly useful for determining the size of functions.
    - The **module name** if the symbol is part of a loadable kernel module.
  - The retrieved details are then formatted and stored in the provided buffer.

- **Curious Questions**:
  - **Q1**: If you have a symbol's address, how can you determine its end address?
    - **Answer**: After using `sprint_symbol`, you'll have both the symbol's start address (provided initially) and its size (retrieved). By adding the size to the start address, you'll get the end address.
  
  - **Q2**: Can `sprint_symbol` be used for symbols not associated with any module?
    - **Answer**: Yes, it can. If the symbol is not part of a module, the function will not append a module name to the output.
  
  - **Q3**: How does `sprint_symbol` help in debugging kernel code?
    - **Answer**: It allows developers to resolve memory addresses back to human-readable function names and their respective sizes. This can be invaluable when analyzing crash logs, memory dumps, or tracing kernel operations.
  
- **In Simple words**:
  - Imagine you're in a giant library 📚, and you have a magical bookmark 🔖 (the address). This bookmark tells you the exact page (address) of a particular story (function) but doesn't tell you its title or how long it is. Now, you use a special gadget (`sprint_symbol`) that, when shown the bookmark, tells you the story's title (function name), how many pages you're into the story (offset), how long the story is (size), and if it's part of a collection (module name). Now, instead of a vague page number, you have a clear picture of the story you're looking at! 📖✨.
