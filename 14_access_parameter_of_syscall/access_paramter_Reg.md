**Accessing System Call Parameters via pt_regs** üñ•Ô∏èüîç

---

- **Explain the Technical Concept**:
  - System calls in the Linux kernel pass their arguments in registers. The `pt_regs` structure contains the values of the processor's registers, reflecting the state of the system just before entering the kernel mode.
  - For x86_64, the first few system call arguments are passed in the `di`, `si`, `dx`, `r10`, `r8`, and `r9` registers.
  - In the provided code, the hooked version of the `open` system call retrieves the values of these registers directly from the `pt_regs` structure.
  - Specifically, `regs->di`, `regs->si`, and `regs->dx` represent the first, second, and third arguments to the system call, respectively.
  
- **Curious Questions**:
  - **Q1**: How are `pt_regs` populated for system calls?
    - **Answer**: When a system call is made, the hardware saves the state of the CPU registers. This saved state is captured in the `pt_regs` structure, which is then passed to the system call handler.
  
  - **Q2**: Can we modify the values in `pt_regs`?
    - **Answer**: Yes, but with caution. Modifying `pt_regs` values affects the execution of the system call. It can be used to change the behavior of the call by altering its arguments.
  
  - **Q3**: What happens if we exceed the number of register-based arguments in a system call?
    - **Answer**: If a system call takes more arguments than can be passed in registers, the additional arguments are passed on the stack. However, most system calls do not exceed this limit.
  
- **Explain in Simple Words for Memory**:
  - Imagine a delivery service üì¶ where each package has a label containing vital information: sender, receiver, weight, etc. Now, when the delivery reaches its destination (in our case, the kernel), the details from this label are used to process the package. The `pt_regs` is similar to this label, containing the vital details (arguments) required to process the system call. We can check the label (`pt_regs`) to know what's inside the package (system call arguments) and even alter it if needed! üè∑Ô∏èüñäÔ∏è.
