**Diving Deep into `kallsyms_on_each_symbol`** üñ•Ô∏èüß©

---

- **Explain the Technical Concept**:
  - The kernel consists of numerous symbols, each representing a specific function or variable.
  - `kallsyms_on_each_symbol` is a powerful utility function provided by the kernel to iterate over all these symbols. 
  - It is designed as a higher-order function, where it takes another function (callback) as an argument and executes that function for every symbol it encounters.
  - The callback function can be tailored to extract or act upon the specific details of each symbol like its name, module, or memory address.
  
- **Curious Questions**:
  - **Q1**: What would be a practical use-case of `kallsyms_on_each_symbol`?
    - **Answer**: This function is immensely helpful for debugging, symbol resolution at runtime, or when developing monitoring tools that need insights into kernel symbols. It can be used to construct a dynamic map of all active symbols in the kernel.
  
  - **Q2**: If you want to list all the symbols associated with a particular module, how would you do it using `kallsyms_on_each_symbol`?
    - **Answer**: You'd design the callback function to check the `module` argument. If it matches the desired module's name, you'd process (or print) the symbol's details. Otherwise, you'd simply move on to the next symbol.
  
  - **Q3**: How does `kallsyms_on_each_symbol` differ from directly reading `/proc/kallsyms`?
    - **Answer**: While `/proc/kallsyms` gives a static snapshot of the symbols, `kallsyms_on_each_symbol` provides a dynamic way to process each symbol programmatically, allowing for custom logic or filtering to be applied directly during the iteration.
  
- **Explain in Simple Words for Memory**:
  - Imagine the kernel as a massive toolbox üß∞ with various tools inside. Each tool (symbol) has a unique name and place inside this box. Now, if you had a magic magnifying glass üîç (kallsyms_on_each_symbol) that could look at each tool one by one, and every time it sees a tool, it calls you to check it out. You can then decide what you want to do with each tool: note its details, use it, or simply move to the next. This gives you a dynamic way to interact with each tool rather than just having a static list of all tools inside. Super handy, right? üõ†Ô∏è‚ú®.
