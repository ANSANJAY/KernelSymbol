**Dynamically Discovering Kernel Load Address and Memory Sections** üêßüß†

---

- **Concept**:
  - The kernel has several memory sections, and they hold specific types of data. Some well-known sections are the text, data, and bss.
  - The text section contains the executable machine code.
  - The data section stores initialized static and global variables.
  - The bss section contains uninitialized static and global variables.
  - In the context of kernel development, it's sometimes essential to know where these sections are loaded in physical memory. This can be achieved dynamically.
  - The `/proc/iomem` file provides a map of the system's physical memory layout. The kernel's load address can be obtained from this file.
  - The `kallsyms_lookup_name` function is used to retrieve the address of a specific symbol, while `__pa_symbol` macro is used to convert this virtual address to a physical address.
  
- **Curious Questions**:
  - **Q1**: Why do you need to know where the kernel is loaded in memory?
    - **Answer**: Knowing the exact address allows for various kernel-related tasks, like debugging, profiling, kernel patching, or other low-level manipulations.
  
  - **Q2**: What's the difference between virtual and physical addresses in this context?
    - **Answer**: The kernel operates in virtual memory, providing an abstraction over the physical memory. Virtual addresses refer to this abstraction, while physical addresses refer to the actual locations in RAM.
  
  - **Q3**: Why are some kernel variables stored in the bss section without initialization?
    - **Answer**: The bss section is for uninitialized data. Variables here are automatically initialized to zero, which saves space in the binary file, as it doesn't need to store an initial value.
  
- **In Simple words**:
  - Think of the kernel as a massive book üìö in a library. This book has different sections (like chapters). Now, if you want to know where each section starts and ends in the library's layout (which could change every time the library is organized), you would use a special tool. The provided code is like that tool for the kernel, telling you where each section is located in the memory "library." This is useful for many deep-dive tasks in kernel space! üßêüîß.
